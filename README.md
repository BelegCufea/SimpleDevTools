# SimpleDevTools

## About

**SimpleDevTools** is a lightweight in-game developer addon for World of Warcraft that provides quick access to common slash commands through a clean, customizable menu.  

Instead of typing long or hard-to-remember commands, you can open a simple menu to execute frequently used developer and debugging tools. Perfect for addon authors, UI tweakers, and anyone who wants faster access to WoW’s hidden utilities.  

## Features

- **Customizable Commands** – Add, edit, or remove your own commands directly in the in-game options.  
- **Built-in Tools** – Includes useful developer commands like `/fstack` (frame stack) and `/etrace` (event trace) out of the box.  
- **Quick Access to Addons** – Easily open popular developer addons like [DevTools](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/devtool), [WoWlua](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/wowlua), [APIInterface](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/apiinterface), and more.  
- **LibDataBroker (LDB) Support** – Displays a neat icon in any LDB display addon (such as ChocolateBar, Titan Panel, etc.) for quick access.  
- **Lightweight by Design** – Minimal performance impact, built for speed and convenience.
